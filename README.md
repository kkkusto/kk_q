Subject: Documentation and Details for Script Execution Workflow

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the file processing and ingestion tasks, I have prepared a set of scripts along with their corresponding documentation. Below are the details:

Attached Files
README File: This document outlines the purpose, steps, and execution details for the scripts used in the workflow.
Excel File: Contains a detailed explanation of the modules involved in the process, including testing status and related comments.
Scripts Overview
The workflow is divided into two primary steps:

File Processing from PNP Path

Extracts, identifies, and processes missing files.
Updates Oracle with the necessary details.
Manual Ingestion and Restoration

Configures the manual ingestion path, updates required parameters, and restores paths post-ingestion.
Both scripts have been tested successfully in QA environments and are ready for execution in production.

Next Steps
Please review the README file and the Excel document to familiarize yourself with the modules and workflow.
Let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.
Once reviewed, we can schedule a walkthrough or training session if required.
Feel free to reach out for any clarifications.
